--Readme document for *Lu He*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I discussed with one of my friend who is a front-end engineer in China. There is a problem raise when I implement the 'Project' sction. 
I have provide the height to each section which is 600px, but when the screen size is between large and medium, the height of the card deck would greater than 600px, which means it will overlap with the footer section. 
I asked suggestion from my friend, and she suggests me to use @media to fix it.


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
There is a folder called images, which includes all the images that I use for this project(such as logo).
